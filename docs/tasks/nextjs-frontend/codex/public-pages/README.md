# Codex Task: Public Pages

## Objective
Deliver the marketing landing page and public login experience using shadcn/ui blocks while keeping content configurable.

## Scope
- Compose a landing page with shadcn/ui blocks using configurable content and the black/white base palette plus `--accent-color`.
- Build the public login page that routes authenticated users to the dashboard after successful authentication.
- Avoid hard-coded copy; keep data sourced from configuration files or props.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Landing page renders with shadcn/ui components and supports runtime accent color overrides.
- Login page is reachable publicly and redirects authenticated users appropriately.
- All public content is configurable without code changes.
