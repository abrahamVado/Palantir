# Codex Task: Testing & Quality Gates

## Objective
Document the expectations for integration coverage, API contract checks, accessibility, and visual regression considerations for the frontend.

## Scope
- Outline integration coverage goals and API contract verification without prescribing specific tools.
- Note accessibility and visual regression considerations and any approvals needed before adding tooling.
- Capture deployment-specific environment variable considerations for Dockerized `next start` targets if they differ by environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Documentation summarizes expected test coverage and contract checks aligned with backend envelopes.
- Accessibility and visual regression strategies are recorded with any gating requirements.
- Environment variable considerations for production deployment are captured for future CI/CD setup.
